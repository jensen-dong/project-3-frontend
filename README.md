## App Description
Waterbnb is a web application designed to help users find and book unique getaways located near or on water bodies such as beaches, lakes, and rivers. Users can search for properties based on location, check availability, and book their preferred dates. The app was built to cater to users looking for unique and scenic waterfront accommodations, offering a niche alternative to traditional vacation rental platforms.
